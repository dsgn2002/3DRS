    <em>Overview of our 3DRS framework for 3D-aware representation supervision in MLLMs.</em>
</p>

---

## Introduction

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized multimodal reasoning, yet **scene understanding in complex 3D environments remains a challenge**. Existing MLLMs, primarily trained on 2D data, lack explicit 3D-aware representation, limiting their effectiveness in spatially-grounded tasks.

**We propose 3DRS**, a general framework that introduces explicit 3D-aware representation supervision into MLLMs using powerful 3D foundation models. By aligning the visual features of MLLMs with rich 3D representations, our method enables stronger geometric and spatial reasoning, bridging the gap between 2D pretraining and real-world 3D scene understanding.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Visual-AI/3DRS.git
    cd 3DRS
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    conda create -n 3drs python=3.10
    conda activate 3drs
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e ".[train]"
    pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation     # install flash attention
    pip install -e transformers
    ```
---

## Preparing the training data

The processed training data is accessible at [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OliverHuang1998/3DRS). You can download it and put as `data/` folder.
Besides, you should create the scannet folder by yourself and put the `posed_images` folder into it. The [mask.zip](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zd11024/Video-3D-LLM_data/blob/main/mask.zip) and [pcd_with_object_aabbs.tar.gz](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zd11024/Video-3D-LLM_data/blob/main/pcd_with_object_aabbs.tar.gz) folders can be downloaded from Video-3D-LLM.

## Extracting VGGT features

You need to download the VGGT model from [vggt](https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/blob/main/model.pt), and put in `checkpoints` folder. 

Afterwards, you need to run the command:

```bash
python extract_vggt_feature
```

This script will extract the vggt features to `data/` folder.

## Model Preparation

The pre-trained LLaVA-Next-Video can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-7B-Qwen2).

Please put it into `data/models` as `LLaVA-Video-7B-Qwen2` folder.

# Data Structure

The final data structure should be organized as follows:
```
data/
├── balanced/
├── benchmark/
├── embodiedscan/
├── metadata/
├── models/
   ├──LLaVA-Video-7B-Qwen2/
├── processed/
└── scannet/
   ├──mask/
   ├──pcd_with_object_aabbs/
   ├──posed_images/
   |──posed_images_3d_feature_vggt/
```

## Run the training and evaluation

```bash
sh train_eval.sh
```

You can modify the `MID_RUN_NAME` to change the name of an experiment, which should be consistent with the name in `train_eval.sh` file.

## 3DRS-G: explicit geometry supervision (extension)

The released objective is `L_CE + L_align`, where `L_align` is a pointwise cosine
term against frozen VGGT features. All of the student's geometry therefore comes
second-hand, which is the ceiling the paper itself names: performance "is
upper-bounded by the quality of the teacher 3D foundation model".

This extension adds supervision that does not route through the teacher. The
ScanNet depth maps and poses are already unprojected by the dataloader (for the
world-position embedding) and were simply never used as a target:

| term | flag | signal |
|---|---|---|
| `align` | `--three_d_align_weight` | baseline cosine distillation from VGGT |
| `relational` | `--three_d_relational_weight` | match the teacher's *pairwise* structure, invariant to a change of basis |
| `geo_point` / `geo_depth` / `geo_normal` | `--three_d_geo_weight` | regress world XYZ, camera depth and local surface orientation from the visual tokens, supervised by sensor depth |
| `corr` | `--three_d_corr_weight` | InfoNCE over patches from different frames that share a voxel |

The last one optimises the paper's own 3D-awareness metric directly. All terms
are masked by depth validity: ScanNet stores 0 where the sensor returned
nothing, and `unproject` maps those pixels onto the camera centre.

**Defaults reproduce the published objective exactly** (align weight 1, the rest
0), so an unflagged run is the baseline. To train the extended version:

```bash
sh scripts/3d/train/train_multi_geo.sh
```

### Verifying without a GPU

```bash
python tools/selftest_3d_supervision.py   # 37 checks, CPU-only, no ScanNet needed
```

Builds a synthetic room with known geometry and checks each loss against ground
truth (a plane must yield a constant normal, dropout patches must not
contribute, 3D-aware features must beat 3D-blind ones on the correspondence
term, defaults must equal the baseline term, gradients must reach every head).

### Measuring the representation, not the loss

The distillation loss value cannot tell "encodes the same geometry in a rotated
basis" apart from "encodes no geometry". `llava/analysis/feature_gap.py` adds
CKA and Procrustes (basis-invariant similarity), mutual-kNN agreement, the
paper's multi-view correspondence score, and a held-out ridge probe from
features to world coordinates:

```bash
python tools/measure_3d_gap.py --model-path ckpt/llavanext-qwen-3drs \
    --num-scenes 50 --layers -1 -3 -5 --output analysis/gap_baseline.json
```

`probe_r2_backbone` is the load-bearing number: it asks whether geometry is in
the backbone features or only in the projection head trained to mimic VGGT.

### Notes

- `--torch_compile` is dropped from the extended training script: the
  correspondence term samples a data-dependent number of anchors each step,
  which triggers recompilation.
- Ablate by setting single weights to 0 -- each term is logged separately
  (`LM Loss: align=... geo_point=... corr=...`).
